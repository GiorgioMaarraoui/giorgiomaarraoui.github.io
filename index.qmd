**PhD Candidate in Economics, University of Manchester**  
**Economic Consultant, World Bank**  

I am in the final write-up year of my PhD in Economics at the University of Manchester, where my research focuses on climate change, migration, and development. My work combines **micro-data analysis**, **spatial equilibrium modelling**, and **policy evaluation** to understand how climate shocks affect livelihoods and welfare across Sub-Saharan Africa.  

At the World Bankâ€™s *Poverty & Equity Global Practice*, I contribute to the **Commitment to Equity (CEQ)** assessments for Pakistan and Djibouti, analysing the distributional and fiscal impacts of taxes and transfers. This experience bridges my academic research with applied economic policy and quantitative evaluation.

**Research and policy interests**  
- Fiscal incidence, inequality, and public policy 
- Climate adaptation and welfare analysis  
- Migration, conflict, and spatial development  
- Applied econometrics and causal inference
